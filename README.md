# Railway-Management-System

This project was made during my high school in Turbo C++. The program supports the following functionality:
* To enter, display or alter the details of different trains and passengers. 
* To reserve or cancel a train ticket. 
* To know the present status of a reserved ticket, i.e. whether the ticket is confirmed or pending. 

Data file handling has been effectively used in the program. This program uses the concept of object-oriented programming
